          The most important thing in my life is my family. I live with my
          beautiful wife, Shannon, and our 4 year old daughter in Toronto, CA. I
          grew up in Connecticut, but since 2021 I've been happily growing roots
          as a permanent resident of Canada. We love travel, music, and
          discovering local spots such as playgrounds and breweries.

          My parents live in North Carolina and are avid golfers. My sister is
          also in North Carolina and teaches music. My inlaws live in Toronto
          and brother-in-law lives with his wife and children in Czech Republic.

        <h2>James Bond</h2>
        <p class="aboutPageCopy" class="JamesBondCopy">
          As far back as I can remember, I've always loved James Bond. As a kid,
          my dad and I watched the classic Sean Connery and Roger Moore films
          together. Since 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, I've seen every film in
          the theatre, many on opening night. While I appreciate all Bond actors
          for their unique characters, my favorite is Daniel Craig for his
          gritty, human portrayal of the original Ian Fleming literary
          character.

        <p class="aboutPageCopy">
          I consider myself an avid reader and have an annual goal for reading
          25 books. I don't reach the goal every year but certainly aspire to!
          My favorite genre is spy fiction but I try to keep my intake balanced
          across genre, fiction/nonfiction, author voices, and subject matter.
          Here are some of my favorite books I've read in recent years -

            My passion for cars began right around the time I turned sixteen and
            began to appreciate beautiful things that can move fast. The Ferrari
            360 had just been released and I intended to one day own one.
            Eventually my interested expanded beyond Italian sports cars where I
            now appreciate cars that are unique, exhibit beauty, reflect their
            time and place. I've enjoyed being a part of the car community,
            owning a few fun cars, and sharing my passion with my daughter who
            now dreams of someday getting a "pink Porsche".
